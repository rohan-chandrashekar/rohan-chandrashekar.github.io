      <h1>Hi, I'm Rohan.</h1>
      <p>I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University and completed a summer internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).</p>
      <p>During my internship, I immersed myself in various advanced topics, including AI for cybersecurity, and BurpSuite for Web LLM attacks. I developed a use case for an AI-powered chatbot to summarize technical cybersecurity documents and integrated the NIST framework to strengthen AI security measures.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am working full-time with HPE’s SQuest framework, which is built on Red Hat’s Ansible Automation Platform, offering a comprehensive Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) experience. My focus areas are AI for Cybersecurity and Automation.</p>
      <p>In parallel, my research interests span Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, NLP, and Cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>For more details on my publications and projects, you can view my portfolio and resume.</p>
